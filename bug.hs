This Haskell code attempts to use a pattern match on a Maybe value without handling the Nothing case, leading to a runtime exception if the value is Nothing. 
```haskell
import Data.Maybe

myFunction :: Maybe Int -> Int
myFunction (Just x) = x * 2
myFunction _ = error "Unexpected Nothing"

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let maybeValue = Nothing
  let result = myFunction maybeValue
  print result
```
