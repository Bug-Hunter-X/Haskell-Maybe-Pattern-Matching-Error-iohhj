The solution handles the `Nothing` case gracefully by providing a default value. 
```haskell
import Data.Maybe

myFunction :: Maybe Int -> Int
myFunction (Just x) = x * 2
myFunction Nothing = 0 -- Handle Nothing case

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let maybeValue = Nothing
  let result = myFunction maybeValue
  print result
```
This corrected version returns 0 when the input is `Nothing`, preventing the runtime error.
